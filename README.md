# Overview
This repository contains code for a React Application that utilizes Spotify's API to display user information. Currently, it allows users to display top tracks over 3 different timeframes:
- Last 4 weeks
- Last 6 months
- Last 12 months

> Your data will be used only to display your top songs and will not be stored or shared beyond this usage.
