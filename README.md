# Overview
This repository contains code for a React Application that utilizes Spotify's API to display user information. Currently, it allows users to display top tracks over 3 different timeframes:
- Last 4 weeks
- Last 6 months
- Last 12 months

> [!IMPORTANT]
If you would like to preview the website and use it I would need to add you as a user to the app. Which requires your email that is connected to your Spotify account. From there I add you as a user and you should be able to use the app.\
>\
> (This will be the method used until Spotify approve my request to change my app from Development mode to Extended quota mode, if they even approve it :sob:) 

# TODO
